# quotes
A collection of quotations. For various reasons I have found them meaningful,
and this repo may thus offer a glimpse into my general outlook and reading
interests, along with some things in a lighter vein. No effort has been made to
organize it yet, and likely will not happen in the future. As such, henceforth
quotes will simply be added at the top. Over time, this repo may thus also
reflect a history of sorts.

Generally, I do not plan on removing quotes - essentially all the quotes here I
still find interesting in hindsight.
